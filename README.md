# python_mysql-training
In here I stored my first project using MySQL and Python.
Finished project.

Also training on using GUI with Python.

The project:
An app made for registering products of x company/seller in a MySQL Table. 
You can edit, list and manage your products with the help of the GUI without needing to open the database in MySQL Workbench.
However, you do have to run the cadastroproj.py on your Python Interpreter; that will trigger the GUI and the Database. (pip install mysql-connector-python //required)
